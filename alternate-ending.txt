Once upon a time in a quiet forest, a curious fox discovered a glowing stone buried beneath the roots of an old oak tree. 
The stone pulsed with a soft blue light, and when the fox touched it, the forest around him shimmered and whispered secrets of the past.
But instead of leaving, the fox buried the stone again, realizing some mysteries are better left untouched.
From that day on, the forest grew even quieter, as if holding its breath, guarding the secret it had once revealed.
